# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

Project to design an NFT preview card component which could then be used in a larger project (e.g. would be perfect as a React component).

My first project trying out the Frontend Mentor platform - the key learning areas were:

I had some trouble styling the SVG view icon and getting the positioning correct inside the main image div.
In the end I added a wrapper div around the SVG and sized that proportionally, then used relative / absolute positioning to manually centre the view icon
I added an 'overlay' div to get the background colour effect on hover
Also added hover effect for the SVG view icon
Overall a good project for getting started on the platform, good for relative beginners as one or two challenging aspects that would probably require researching and learning especially around positioning elements and using hover effects.
